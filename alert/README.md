## Getting Started

Copy the files in the `ic10` directory into your IC10 editor.  Review the operations manuals to understand configuration parameters and hardware mappings before deployment.

To experiment or test with code before deploying in-game use the [Stationeers Code Simulator](https://ic10.dev/), a browser-based IC10 environment.
