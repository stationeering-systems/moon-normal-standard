# Portable Systems

## Overview

This directory contains IC10 code for normal-tier Portable Systems.  It's designed for modular integration into base infrastructure, in support of EVA operations or for systems that may not have nor need direct access to major gas supply infrastructure.

For full design rationale, system theory, and detailed guides, visit the Stationeering Systems Substack:

## Getting Started

Copy the files in the `ic10` directory into your IC10 editor.  Review the operations manuals to understand configuration parameters and hardware mappings before deployment.

To experiment or test with code before deploying in-game use the [Stationeers Code Simulator](https://ic10.dev/), a browser-based IC10 environment.
