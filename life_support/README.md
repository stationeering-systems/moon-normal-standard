# Life Support Systems

## Overview

This directory contains IC10 code and in-game documentation for normal-tier Life Support Systems. Itâ€™s designed for modular integration into base infrastructure, providing reliable zone atmospheric control.

For full design rationale, system theory, and detailed guides, visit the [Stationeering Life Support Systems](https://stationeering.substack.com/p/life-support-systems-engineering) series on Substack.

## Getting Started

Copy the files in the `ic10` directory, and optionally the `docs_ic10` directory into your IC10 editor.  Review the operations manuals to understand configuration parameters and hardware mappings before deployment.

To experiment or test with code before deploying in-game use the [Stationeers Code Simulator](https://ic10.dev/), a browser-based IC10 environment.
