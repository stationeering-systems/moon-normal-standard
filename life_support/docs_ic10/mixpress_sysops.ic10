# MIXTURE-PRESSURE CONTROL - OPERATIONS MANUAL
#
# SYSTEM PURPOSE
# Regulates zone pressure and atmospheric mixture
# while maintaining safe exhaust pipe pressures.
#
# FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
# * Activates ventilation systems to maintain
#   correct atmospheric pressures and gas ratios.
# * Monitors waste pipe pressure to ensure safe
#   levels and activates pumps as needed.
# * Inward vents take precedence over outward
#   vents when zone pressure exceeds target.
#
# HARDWARE INTERFACE
# * d0: Pressure kPa
# * d1: Zone Size GU
# * d2: Ratio Carbon Dioxide decimal
# * d3: Ratio Nitrogen decimal
# * d4: Ratio Oxygen decimal
#
# CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
# SafetyPressure:       48636
# PressureTolerance:    3
# MinDisplacement:      0.3
# WaitDelay:            2
# LocalCarbonDioxide:   "ZoneCarbonDioxide"
# LocalNitrogen:        "ZoneNitrogen"
# LocalOxygen:          "ZoneOxygen"
# LocalExhaust:         "ZoneExhaust"
#
# GAS SELECTION BEHAVIOR
# * Pressure Corrections: Opportunistic
#   selection - first available gas activates.
# * Composition Corrections: Priority selection
#   - deficient gas maintains priority until
#   composition targets are achieved.
#
# MAINTENANCE & TROUBLESHOOTING
#
# HIGH ZONE PRESSURE
#
# STEP 1: Check Power
# 1.1 Are inward vents powered/pulsing (1-sec)?
#   NO  → Check controller/network power.
#   YES → Continue to Step 2.
#
# STEP 2: Check Flow Rates
# 2.1 Are inward vents operating optimally?
#   NO  → Continue to Step 2.2
#   YES → Check for circulation/gas leaks.
#
# 2.2 Is exhaust pressure above safety limits?
#   NO  → Further investigation required.
#   YES → Verify pump activation/throughput.
#
# Emergency: Manual vent via airlock valve
#
# LOW ZONE PRESSURE
#
# STEP 1: Check Power
# 1.1 Are outward vents powered/pulsing (1-sec)?
#   NO  → Check controller/network power.
#   YES → Continue to Step 2.
#
# STEP 2: Check Flow Rates
# 2.1 Are outward vents operating optimally?
#   NO  → Continue to Step 2.2
#   YES → Check for circulation/gas leaks.
#
# 2.2 Is gas pressure ≥471 kPa in local pipe?
#   NO  → Continue to Step 3.
#   YES → Further investigation required.
#
# STEP 3: Check Distribution Network
# 3.1 Is main line pressure ≥471 kPa?
#   NO  → Refer to PGL System Operations.
#   YES → Check valve installation/position.
#
# LOW GAS COMPOSITION
#
# STEP 1: Check Power
# 1.1 Are target vents powered/pulsing (2-sec)?
#   NO  → Check controller/network power.
#   YES → Continue to Step 2.
#
# STEP 2: Check Flow Rates
# 2.1 Are target vents operating optimally?
#   NO  → Continue to Step 2.2
#   YES → Check for circulation/gas leaks.
#
# 2.2 Is target gas pressure ≥471 kPa?
#   NO  → Continue to Step 3.
#   YES → Further investigation required.
#
# STEP 3: Check Distribution Network
# 3.1 Is main line pressure ≥471 kPa?
#   NO  → Refer to PGL System Operations.
#   YES → Check valve installation/position.
#
# NOTES
# * Vents pulse activation rather than run
#   continuously to allow equalization time.
# * Waste management operates independently
#   of atmospheric control functions.
