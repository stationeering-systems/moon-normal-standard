# Life Support Readiness Checklist
#
# This checklist must be completed before full
# system integration. It ensures all life support
# control systems are flashed, wired, labeled, and
# verified.
#
# MixPress Controller Test
#
# 1. Power on controller
# 2. Monitor pressure on primary console
# 3. Verify pressure within target thresholds
#
# 4. Switch gas ratios on secondary console
# 5. Compare against baseline measurements
# 6. Observe gas selection behavior:
#  - Pressure: First available activates
#  - Composition: Deficient gas priority
#
# Waste Management Validation
#
# 1. Monitor exhaust pressure levels
# 2. Assert pumps inactive during normal operation
# 3. If exhaust pressure > safety threshold:
#  - Verify pump activation
#  - Check throughput rates
#
# Ventilation System Test
#
# 1. Inward vents powered/pulsing (1-sec)?
# 2. Outward vents powered/pulsing (1-sec)?
# 3. Target vents pulsing (max 1-sec)?
# 4. Verify inward precedence over outward
#
# Operational Validation
#
# Monitor first several atmospheric cycles:
# 1. Pressure regulation stable
# 2. Gas ratios trending to targets
# 3. Pumps inactive (normal operation)
# 4. Power within load leveling limits
#
# System Integration Check
#
# 1. Main/local gas line pressure >=471 kPa?
# 2. No pipe ruptures detected?
# 3. Valve positions correct?
#
# Note: Full verification may take up to 15
# minutes to confirm all atmospheric cycles
# complete.
