# THERMAL EXCHANGE COOLER - SYSTEM OPERATIONS
# MANUAL
#
# SYSTEM PURPOSE
# Flushes the cooling loop when the Thermal Regulator
# is deactivated to prevent condensation buildup.
#
# FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
# * Monitors the Thermal Regulator valve state.
# * When the regulator is disabled, flushes any
#   remaining gas from the pipe.
#
# HARDWARE INTERFACE
# Controller Slot (db): IC10 - TEC-C
# d0: Thermal Regulator (controls access to cooling)
#
# PIPE CONNECTIONS
# Input: TEC-V Output2
# Output: Unused
# Output2: TEC-V Output2
#
# POWER DOMAIN
# Runs on ARU-CRT (Red) line. Cooling evacuation
# remains operational during transformer failure.
#
# NOTES
# * Designed to fail safe: if the controller is offline,
#   cooling gases may remain trapped, increasing the
#   risk of condensation and pipe failure.
# * Logic checks for Thermal Regulator power. If the
#   valve is unpowered (disabled), evacuation is
#   immediately triggered to prevent coolant entrapment.
