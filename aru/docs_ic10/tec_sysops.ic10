# THERMAL EXCHANGE CORE - SYSTEM OPERATIONS
# MANUAL
#
# SYSTEM PURPOSE
# Pumps gases from the Exchange Capture Line into
# the Thermal Exchange Core for cooling and filtering.
#
# FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
# - Cools or heats gases to target temperature.
# - Commands gas intake based on pressure/temp targets
#   or poor condensation efficiency.
# - Removes volatiles via TEC-V filtration.
# - Vents condensed NO2 and Pollutant via passive drain.
# - Manual release valve allows line purge when needed.
#
# TEMPERATURE CONTROL
# - Heating: Activates heater when below MinTemperature.
# - Cooling: Activates cooling loop above MaxTemperature.
# - TEC-C flushes cooling pipe when regulator is off.
#
# HARDWARE INTERFACE
# Controller Slot (db): IC10 - TEC Filtration Unit
# d0: Pipe Heater
# d1: Thermal Regulator
#
# PIPE CONNECTIONS
# Input: Exchange Capture Line
# Output: Volatiles Purge Vent
# Output2: PGL Intake and Cooling Loop
#
# POWER DOMAIN
# TEC-C uses ARU-CRT (Red) to ensure safe flushing
# during main transformer failure.
#
# CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
# MaxPressure: 48636 (kPa)
# MinPressure: 6.3 (kPa)
# MaxTemperature: 303.15 (K)
# MinTemperature: 293.15 (K)
# MinPressureVolume: 30000 (kPa*L)
# CondensationRatio: 13.79 (kPa/K)
#
# FAILSAFE
# A failsafe disables the transformer if pipe pressure
# drops to zero to prevent gas loss. Manual reset needed.
#
# FAILSAFE RESET PROCEDURE
# 1. Confirm output pressure = 0 kPa
# 2. Verify manual release valve is closed
# 3. Inspect & repair TEC to filtration piping
# 4. Disable 'Failsafe Control' logic writer
# 5. Manually enable transformer
# 6. When stable, re-enable 'Failsafe Control'
#
# If transformer is powered but unit is not:
# - Check wiring
# - Confirm transformer wattage is sufficient
#
# MAINTENANCE & TROUBLESHOOTING
#
# STEP 1: POWER
# 1.1 Is unit powered?
#     NO -> go to 1.2, YES -> 2
# 1.2 Is transformer on?
#     NO -> See failsafe reset
#     YES -> 1.3
# 1.3 Is transformer receiving power?
#     NO -> Check ARU power
#     YES -> Check wiring / transformer rating
#
# STEP 2: OUTPUT PIPE
# 2.1 Is output P*V ≥ 30000?
#     NO -> 3, YES -> Normal
#
# STEP 3: FILTRATION UNIT
# 3.1 Are filters empty?
#     YES -> Replace, NO -> 4
#
# STEP 4: INPUT PIPE
# 4.1 Is pressure ≥ 6.3 kPa?
#     NO -> Normal, YES -> Investigate
#
# NOTES
# - Unit runs while waste gases are present
# - Pump fails open if regulator is unpowered
# - Backup power ensures safe shutdown
# - Failsafe disables Heater, Regulator, Filtration
