# PROCESSED GAS LINE - SYSTEM OPERATIONS MANUAL
#
# SYSTEM PURPOSE
# Pumps and separates gases from the Thermal
# Exchange Core to the Processed Gas Line for
# storage and recirculation.
#
# FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
# * Operates PGL filtration units for Oxygen,
# Nitrogen, and Carbon Dioxide.
# * Evaluates gas temperature and pressure-volume
# thresholds.
# * Verifies gas composition meets minimum ratio.
# * Activates the corresponding PGL unit to
# transfer gas into its dedicated line.
# * Prevents gas movement if temperature or purity
# conditions are not met.
#
# HARDWARE INTERFACE
# * Controller Slot (db): IC10 - Any PGL unit
#

#
# DEVICE MAPPING
# Each gas type must include:
# * Filtration: Manages gas throughput to PGL line.
#
# PIPE CONNECTIONS
# Input:
# * TEC-V Output2 (shared line from TEC)
# Output:
# * Insulated lines routed to gas storage tanks:
#   - Oxygen
#   - Nitrogen
#   - Carbon Dioxide
#
# MAINTENANCE & TROUBLESHOOTING
#
# STEP 1: Check Power
# 1.1 Is filtration unit powered?
#   NO  → Check ARU system power.
#   YES → Continue to Step 2.
#
# STEP 2: Check Output Pipe
# 2.1 Is output pressure < 48636 kPa?
#   NO  → System Normal.
#   YES → Continue to Step 3.
#
# STEP 3: Check Filtration Unit
# 3.1 Are filters empty?
#   NO  → Continue to Step 4.
#   YES → Replace filters and retest.
#
# STEP 4: Check Input Pipe (from TEC)
# 4.1 Is temperature between 293.15–303.15 K?
#   NO  → System Normal.
#   YES → Continue to 4.2
#
# 4.2 Is pressure*volume ≥ 10000 kPa·L?
#   NO  → System Normal.
#   YES → Continue to 4.3
#
# 4.3 Is gas ratio ≥ 0.33?
#   NO  → System Normal.
#   YES → Further investigation needed.
#
# NOTES
# * Only one IC10 controller is required to manage
#   all connected PGL filtration units.
# * Each unit must be properly labeled and piped
#   to avoid cross-contamination.
# * Unqualified gases remain in TEC pipes until
#   all filtration conditions are satisfied.
