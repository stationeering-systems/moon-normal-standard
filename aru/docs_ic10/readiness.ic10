# Readiness Checklist
#
# This checklist must be completed before full
# system integration. It ensures all atmospheric
# control systems are flashed, wired, labeled, and
# verified.
#
# Failsafe Control
#
# 1. Verify no pressure on the TEC line
# 2. Power on TEC-FS
# 3. Power on Failsafe Control
# 4. Assert TEC-FS shuts off
# 5. Power off Failsafe Control
# 6. Power on TEC-FS
#
# 7. Confirm Volatiles filters installed on TEC-V
# 8. Power on TEC-V (unflashed)
# 9. Load gas above 6.3 kPa from the ECL
# 10. Power on Failsafe Control
# 11. Assert TEC-FS remains on
# 12. Power off Failsafe Control
# 13. Power off TEC-V
#
# TEC-C Cooling Loop
#
# 1. Flash the TEC-C controller
# 2. Power on TEC-C
# 3. Assert TEC-C is IDLE
# 4. Power on the Thermal Regulator valve
# 5. Verify gas in cooling pipe, TEC-C stays IDLE
# 6. Power off the Thermal Regulator valve
# 7. Assert:
#  - TEC-C active while flushing gas
#  - Cooling pipe is empty after flush
# TEC-V Filtration Controller
#
# 1. Flash the TEC-V controller
# 2. Power on TEC-V
# 3. Remove filters
# 4. Assert TEC-V is IDLE
#
# 5. If volatile contamination suspected:
#  - Open manual release valve
#  - Confirm pipe is cleared
#
# 6. Restore filters
# 7. Assert:
#  - TEC-V activates if intake >= 6.3 kPa
#  - TEC pipe < 48636 kPa
#
# 8. If TEC pipe exceeds 51675 kPa:
#  - Shut down device
#  - Review controller logic
#
# Note: Full verification may take time to confirm
#
# Thermal Activation Check
#
# 1. Lower TEC gas temp below 293.15 K
#  - Assert heating is active
# 2. Raise TEC gas temp above 298.15 K
#  - Assert cooling is active
# 3. Set gas temp within range
#  - Assert no thermal elements are active
#
# PGL Filtration Control
#
# 1. Flash PGL controller
# 2. Confirm activation triggers when:
#  - Temp is within range
#  - Pressure × volume ≥ 10000 kPa*L
#  - Gas ratio meets threshold
# 3. Remove filter during active cycle
#  - Assert unit returns to IDLE
# 4. Restore filter
#
# Note: Full verification may take time to confirm
