# Atmospheric Recovery Unit (ARU)

## Overview

This directory contains IC10 code for the normal-tier Atmospheric Recovery Unit (ARU). Itâ€™s designed for modular integration into base infrastructure, providing reliable atmospheric control.

For full design rationale, system theory, and detailed guides, visit the [Stationeering Atmospheric Systems](https://stationeering.substack.com/p/atmospheric-recovery-on-the-moon) series on Substack.

## Getting Started

Copy the files in the `ic10` directory into your IC10 editor.  Review the operations manuals to understand configuration parameters and hardware mappings before deployment.

To experiment or test with code before deploying in-game use the [Stationeers Code Simulator](https://ic10.dev/), a browser-based IC10 environment.
